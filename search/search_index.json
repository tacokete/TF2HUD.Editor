For issues not on this page, please open a ticket on our issue tracker . For questions not covered in the documentation, visit our Discord server . The latest release does not contain the executable. You most likely downloaded the source code instead of the editor. On the releases page, make sure to download the file named TF2HUD.Editor.zip and extract it into a separate folder. The editor does not launch after downloading and extracting it. Make sure to install the version of Microsoft .NET 5.0 Runtime inteded for running desktop apps . If you just installed it and the editor still does not launch, then restart your system. Customization changes are not being shown in-game. To see your selected changes in-game, open the console and input hud_reloadscheme . This will refresh the HUD with your selected customizations. Note Certain settings may require the game to be restarted, this mainly applies to color and main menu changes. If the game is running, a message will display notifying you that a game restart is required. Error when applying or resetting HUD customizations. Most errors you'll encounter will be caused by an outdated version of the HUD being installed. An outdated HUD may not have the latest changes that the editor would expect and when that happens, an error is returned. Best thing to do is reinstall the HUD through the editor and reapply the customizations.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"json/animations/","text":"A definition of a HUD animations file contains event names and values, where each value contains a list of HUD animation objects. The main properties for writing a standard HUD animation are: Type Element Property Value Interpolator Delay Duration Warning Unlike HUD files, animation events are not merged, and each time an Event is written, it overwrites the other occurences of that event (in the current file).

The files property can contain 0 or more file paths relative to the root of the HUD. Each file path can be seperated by slash (/), backslash (\\) or double backslash (\\\\). Note Files that have the extensions .res , .vmt and .vdf are treated as HUD files, files that have the .txt extension are treated as HUD Animations files. For more information on HUD animations, see HUD Animations . If the file does not exist, TF2HUD.Editor will create it with the values specified. If it does, the editor will merge the values specified with the already existing HUD values. The value of the current control can be used for or inside a HUD element value by using the $value keyword. Values of other controls can be accessed using a dollar sign and the ID of the control { \"Files\" : { \"resource/clientscheme.res\" : { \"Scheme\" :{ \"Colors\" : { \"Health Colour\" : \"$value\" } } } } } For HUD files that have a header element that matches their file name (such as \"Resource/UI/HudMedicCharge.res\" ), the editor will apply the values specified inside the header element, for other files (such as clientscheme files), the object will need to specify the absolute desired location of the value. Containing header element: \"Files\" : { \"resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res\" : { // Resource/UI/HudPlayerHeal t h.res is n o t prese nt \"PlayerStatusHealthValue\" : { \"fgcolor\" : \"$value\" } } } No containing header element: \"Files\" : { \"resource/clientscheme.res\" : { \"Scheme\" : { \"Colors\" : { \"Health Color\" : \"$value\" } } } } Note that the following example is NOT correct: \"Files\" : { \"resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res\" : { // \"Resource/UI/HudPlayerHealth.res\" is prese nt , bu t will be i ns ide i tself ! \"Resource/UI/HudPlayerHealth.res\" : { \"PlayerStatusHealthValue\" : { \"fgcolor\" : \"$value\" } } } } Special Keys Special keys can appear anywhere within a file entry in the Files object, however they are performed before the HUD properties are written to the file and will not appear inside the HUD file. Special Keys also do not care about the structure of the HUD elements, and will overwrite instances of their instructions anywhere. Replace The replace special key is for use with the CheckBox control (see Controls ). It takes a list that contains 2 strings of text and replaces raw text in the file based on the value of the CheckBox If the checkbox is checked, the editor will replace all occurences of the first item in the list with the second item. if the CheckBox is unchecked, the editor will replace all occurences of the second item in the list with the first item. { ... \"replace\" : [ \"Red\" , \"Green\" ] ... } Always ensure your replace usage is as greedy as possible, for example the following code will leak text and break the HUD: { ... \"replace\" : [ \"HUD_Font_\" , \"HUD_Font_Lato_\" ] ... } After being run multiple times, this code will result in HUD_Font_Lato_Lato_Lato_Lato_ Warning It is not recommended to write VDF in the parameters of a special key, as the formatting of the HUD will change when the editor writed the specified properties HUD Element Keywords Unlike Special Keys, HUD element keywords work within the structure of a HUD file. True/False The true/false object will evaluate the value of the CheckBox control and return the value that matches the setting of the CheckBox control. { \"Label\" : \"Enable Custom Crosshair\" , ... \"Files\" : { \"scripts/hudlayout.res\" : { \"Crosshair\" : { \"visible\" : { \"true\" : \"1\" , \"false\" : \"0\" } } } } Assuming the CheckBox is checked, this will result in the following \"Crosshair\" { ... \"visible\" \"1\" ... } True/False (Ternary) Currently, you can evaluate the value of a CheckBox using a ternary expression wrapped in curly braces. { \"Files\" :{ \"scripts/hudlayout.res\" : { \"Crosshair\" : { \"visible\" : \"{$value ? 1 : 0}\" } } } } The ternary statement can also be used inline with other values { \"scripts/hudlayout.res\" : { \"Crosshair\" : { \"font\" : \"Crosshair Size $value | Outline {$my_hud_enable_crosshair_outline ? ON : OFF}\" } } } When compiled, this will result in the following \"Crosshair\" { \"font\" \"Crosshair Size 32 | Outline ON\" } Operating System Tags Operating System Tags can be represents by putting a ^ followed by the tag in the property name ... \"xpos\" : \"10\" , \"xpos^[$WIN32]\" : \"20\" ...
